    <string name="large_text">
        "The name "Telangana" refers to the word Trilinga Desa, earned due to the presence of three ancient Shiva Temples at Kaleshwaram, Srisailam, and Draksharamam.A more historical reasoning is that during the reign of Nizams, the region was known as Telugu Angana to differentiate itfrom the areas where Marathi was spoken.\n\n"

        "Telangana region has been ruled by great dynasties such as Sathavahanas, Kakatiyas, Chalukyas,Mughals, Qutubshahis, Asafjahis. Kakathiyas contributions to architecture are considered most impressive while Sathavahanas ruled Telangana region for about 400 years right from the 2nd century B.C. to beyond the 2nd century A.D.Among Kakathiyas Prataparudra, was a great ruler who ruled till A.D.1323.\n\n"

        "During the rule of Bahamani, Quli Qutub, born in Persia, came to Deccan and he had become the Governor of this region. Quli Qutub later became independent and formed his own Qutubshahi Dynasty in 1518. The Golkonda fort was built by Quli qutub. In his reign, two tanks such as Ibrahim Pantam tank and Hussainsagar were built including a bridge on river Musi, which is known as Puranapul. The Hindus of Telangana region remember him for his immense patronage of Telugu literature. Many Telugu poets such as Addanki Gangadhar Kavi, Panuganti Telanganarya, Kandukuri Rudra Kavi had flourished in his court.\n\n"

        "Qutubshah then shifted the capital from Golkonda to Hyderabad on the banks of the river Musi. He built the Jamia mosque at Charminar. The State of Hyderabad was eventually founded by Mir Qamruddin Chin Qilich Khan. Later, he conferred himself the title of Asaf Jah, by which title the dynasty is still known.\n\n"

        "In 1799, the Nizam rulers aided the East India Company in their war with Tipu Sultan. When the Nizam was compelled to sign a subsidiary alliance with the British in the year 1799, he lost his authority over the state’s defence and its external affairs. The Nizam also had to give up the Coastal Andhra and the Rayalaseema regions of his vast kingdom to the British, as he was unable to pay monetarily for the assistance the Britishmrendered during the Nizam’s wars against Tipu Sultan. Coastal Andhra and Rayalaseema then became part of the British Presidency of Madras, while Telangana became part of the princely state of Hyderabad. For a long time, them Nizam lead a privileged and a charmed life. He was considered to be the world’s richest man of his time. \n\n"

        "Nizam Mir Usman Ali Khan Bahadur was conferred with the title of “His Exalted Highness. Geographically, Hyderabad commanded a pivotal position in the heart of India with a population of nearly sixteen million and an area of 82,000 square miles. Hyderabad boasted of its own coinage, paper currency and stamps. Soon afternthe announcement of India’s independence, the Nizam declared his intention not to send representatives to either the Constituent.\n\n"

        "The Indian Government refused to entertain a request that Hyderabad would seek a separate status and Operation Polo was initiated to annex Hyderabad state. The Kannada and Marathi speaking areas of Hyderabad state was then merged with Karnataka and Maharashtra respectively while Telugu speaking region of Telangana was merged with Andhra state with Hyderabad as the capital of united Andhra Pradesh state in 1956. Although there was resentment against the merger, there was a period of calm. \n

        "After the promises made to respect the rights of Telangana were not fulfilled, a separate Telangana agitation was launched in 1969. Following subsequent Gentleman’s agreement and again a period of broken promises and injustice, Telangana movement was given a final push by Shri. K Chandrasekhar Rao in 2001 with the formation of TRS. Finally due to the whole hearted efforts of Telangana society and political parties, the Government of India agreed for creation of a separate Telangana state in July, 2013 and Telangana came into effect on June 2, 2014 as ‘Telangana state’, the 29th state of Indian Union. \n\n"

    <string name="birla_history">"  Birla Mandir is a Hindu temple, built on a 280 feet (85 m) high hillock called Naubath Pahad on a 13 acres (53,000 m2) plot. The construction took 10 years and was constructed in 1976 by Swami Ranganathananda of Ramakrishna Mission. The temple was constructed by Birla Foundation, which has also constructed several similar temples across India, all of which are known as Birla Mandir.\n\n"
    "<b>Architecture\n</b>"
    "The temple manifests a blend of Dravidian, Rajasthani and Utkala architectures. It is constructed of 2000 tons of pure white marble. The granite idol of presiding deity Lord Venkateswara is about 11 ft (3.4 m) tall and a carved lotus forms an umbrella on the top. There is a brass flagstaff in the temple premises which rises to a height of 42 ft (13 m). The temple does not have traditional bells, as Swami Ranganathananda wished that the temple atmosphere should be conducive for meditation.\n"
    "<b>About the temple\n</b>"
        "Apart from the main shrine, the consorts of Lord Venkateswara, Padmavati and Andal are housed in separate shrines. The temple also has separate shrines for various Hindu gods and goddess including Shiva, Shakti, Ganesh, Hanuman, Brahma, Saraswati,Lakshmi and Saibaba. Selected teachings of holy men and Gurbani are engraved on temple walls. Birla temples are open to all, as identified by Mahatma Gandhi and other Hindu leaders.\n"

        "   Shri Jagannath means the lord of the universe, the supreme solace and a savior for countless devotees across the globe. Since times immemorial, the powerful god’s magnificent and monumental shrine in Orissa draws lakhs of devotees. Jagannath Temple is dedicated to revered God Shri Krishna. Jagan means Universe and Nath is the Lord. He is one of the incarnations of Vishnu.\n\n"
        "This temple is a replica of the original Jagannath Temple of Puri. However, this temple is much smaller and its design resembles the one in Puri, Orissa. The Hyderabad version of Puri’s temple was built on 3000-square yard area. It is located adjacent to the Telangana Bhavan in the posh suburbs of Banjara Hills. This temple is so captivating that it is tagged as one of the must-visit places of Hyderabad. The most appealing portion of the temple is its “Shikaram” (the peak or the top). It is about 70 feet in height. Sand stones brought from Orissa have been used in the construction of this temple, and that justifies its red colour and around 60 sculptors were employed to carve this awe-inspiring temple.\n\n"
        "The main idols of the temple are Lord Krishna along with his brother BalaRama and sister Subhadra. It also houses five small temples in the premises, that are dedicated to Lord Ganesh (which is to the left of main entrance), Lord Shiva (in the front), Goddess Bhimala ( to the left on back side), Goddess Lakshmi ( to the right) and two shrines for Navagraha and Shri Hanuman. The temple has three entrances while the main entrance opens right in front of the main temple. One cannot miss noticing the intricately done exterior carving which is considered iconic. The exteriors of the temple are completely made of sand stone while the sanctum sanctorum is done in plain brick wall from the inside. It is considered as one of the modern architectural marvels of Hyderabad city and draws hundreds of visitors every day. It is a place where the city’s Oriya community bond together.\n\n"

        "   One of the old and among the most revered temples of Hyderabad is the Yellamma Temple located at Balkampet, popularly called the Balkampet Yellamma temple. The temple is thronged by heavy crowd on Sundays and Tuesdays and is quite famous for the annual Bonalu Jathara festivity that takes place in Hyderabad.\n\n"
        "This temple is dedicated to Goddess Yellamma that literally means 'mother of the universe\'. There is also an alternative name called Jagadamba who is considered the same as Goddess Renuka. According to a legend, Renuka, the daughter of Raja Renuka had married Jamadagni, the son of Satyawati and had five sons, one of them being Parashurama. One day, Renuka couldn\'t perform one of her regular household chores and this enraged her husband who then asked her to leave the house.Dejected Renuka was reportedly suggested by saints to perform pujas near a Shivalinga and feed Brahmins for her penance. Jamadagni was reportedly furious at her and demanded his sons as well to punish their mother Renuka. Others refused and they were burnt to ashes by the father\'s gaze while Parashurama searched for his mother who was hiding in a village, beheaded her and even the poor woman who helped her. Jamadagni who was pleased by his son\'s obedience, gave him a boon and in turn Parashurama asked his father to restore the lives of his brothers, his mother and the village woman. However, during the process, the head of Renuka was restored on the other woman\'s head and vice versa. While Jamadagni accepted the woman who had Renuka\'s body, the other form came to be popular known as Yellamma, which means mother to all and is being devoutly worshipped from then by the people ofTelangana people.\n\n"
        "Balkampet Yellamma Goddess is also considered as an incarnation of Goddess Kali. Devotees offer animal sacrifice here. The most important event here is the celestial marriage ceremony of the temple goddess, Yellamma Kalyanotsavam. Bonalu Jathara Festival at Balkampet Yellamma Temple falls in the calendar only after Golconda Bonalu Jathara followed by Ujjaini Mahankali Bonalu Jathara each year.\n\n"
		"The temple was first constructed in 15th Century AD and later renovated in the early 20th century. The idol of the goddess here is seen 10 feet lower than the ground level and the devouts believe that the water in the well here can cure all ailments. The holy water is treated as Theertham. The temple also has Akhand Jyothi, which was lit during the renovation. It is situated at a distance of 10 km from Secunderabad Railway Station and is just 3 km away from Ameerpet junction.\n\n"

        "   One of the most revered temples of Hyderabad is the Peddamma Temple in Jubilee Hills. There is no clear evidence on when the temple was established, but people consider that it has been here since 150 years. Earlier, it was a small temple but in the year 1993, it gained immense popularity and the Rajagopuram was constructed. The temple witnesses hundreds of devotees pouring in everyday to seek the blessings of Amma. The Peddamma Temple is quite popular in the twin cities, next only to Ujjaini Mahakali Gudi of Secunderabad. The temple is dedicated to Ammavaru who is seen as the mother and people coming to this temple believe that the Goddess is their saviour. The Telangana festival Bonalu is celebrated once in a year, but at this temple, the Bonalu utsavam is celebrated every Sunday. Besides the common people, scores of VIPs, politicians and industrialists visit this temple to offer prayers to the Amma.\n\n"
        "According to the legend, Lord Shiva, the supreme ascetic, when disturbed by the hostility opened his third eye, which led to the unleashing of fire of doom. Even this couldn\'t arrest Mahishasura\'s march. At that moment, a bright stream of lightning dazzled from the mouths of the creator Brahma, in the form of Goddess Brahmi. Simultaneously, the powers of all the other gods became taking one female form as Mahishasura Mardini, Durga, who killed Mahishasura with her bare hands. The temple is located close to the main road on Jubilee Hills Road No. 55 on the main thoroughfare from Jubilee Hills check post to Hi-tech city.\n\n"

        "   Sri Ujjaini Mahakaali Temple is a popular temple devoted to Goddess Mahakaali in Secunderabad area of Telangana. Devotees offer their prayers to the goddess every day at this 190-year old temple.\n\n"
        "According to legend, in the year 1813, a Military Battalion was transferred to Ujjaini. This was a time when there was Cholera outbreak and thousands of people had reportedly perished. Suriti Appaiah who was part of the Military Battalion and his associates reportedly went to Mahakali Devasthanam at Ujjaini and offers prayers that if the people were saved from this epidemic, they would be installing the idol of Mahakaali at Secunderabad. Promptly after his return from Ujjaini, Sri Suriti Appaiah and his associates went ahead and installed the idol of Goddess Mahakaali which was made of wood at Secunderabad in July 1815. During the construction of sanctum sanctorum, a stone idol of Manikyalamma was reportedly found and even that idol was reportedly installed beside Sri Mahakaali Ammavaru.\n\n"
		"Sri Suriti Appaiah later developed the temple with the help of philanthropic people and this was eventually taken over by the endowments department. Thousands of devotees offer prayers during Ashada jathara, which usually falls on Sunday and Monday.\n\n"
		"The goddess Ujjain Mahakaali is seen in a Padmasana posture with four hands along with a sword, spear and also a essel of amrut damaru in the form of a beautiful stone idol. The idol is covered with silver and devotees make sacrifices after fulfillment of their wishes.\n\n"
