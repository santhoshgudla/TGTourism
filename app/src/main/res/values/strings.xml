    <string name="large_text">
        "The name "Telangana" refers to the word Trilinga Desa, earned due to the presence of three ancient Shiva Temples at Kaleshwaram, Srisailam, and Draksharamam.A more historical reasoning is that during the reign of Nizams, the region was known as Telugu Angana to differentiate itfrom the areas where Marathi was spoken.\n\n"

        "Telangana region has been ruled by great dynasties such as Sathavahanas, Kakatiyas, Chalukyas,Mughals, Qutubshahis, Asafjahis. Kakathiyas contributions to architecture are considered most impressive while Sathavahanas ruled Telangana region for about 400 years right from the 2nd century B.C. to beyond the 2nd century A.D.Among Kakathiyas Prataparudra, was a great ruler who ruled till A.D.1323.\n\n"

        "During the rule of Bahamani, Quli Qutub, born in Persia, came to Deccan and he had become the Governor of this region. Quli Qutub later became independent and formed his own Qutubshahi Dynasty in 1518. The Golkonda fort was built by Quli qutub. In his reign, two tanks such as Ibrahim Pantam tank and Hussainsagar were built including a bridge on river Musi, which is known as Puranapul. The Hindus of Telangana region remember him for his immense patronage of Telugu literature. Many Telugu poets such as Addanki Gangadhar Kavi, Panuganti Telanganarya, Kandukuri Rudra Kavi had flourished in his court.\n\n"

        "Qutubshah then shifted the capital from Golkonda to Hyderabad on the banks of the river Musi. He built the Jamia mosque at Charminar. The State of Hyderabad was eventually founded by Mir Qamruddin Chin Qilich Khan. Later, he conferred himself the title of Asaf Jah, by which title the dynasty is still known.\n\n"

        "In 1799, the Nizam rulers aided the East India Company in their war with Tipu Sultan. When the Nizam was compelled to sign a subsidiary alliance with the British in the year 1799, he lost his authority over the state’s defence and its external affairs. The Nizam also had to give up the Coastal Andhra and the Rayalaseema regions of his vast kingdom to the British, as he was unable to pay monetarily for the assistance the Britishmrendered during the Nizam’s wars against Tipu Sultan. Coastal Andhra and Rayalaseema then became part of the British Presidency of Madras, while Telangana became part of the princely state of Hyderabad. For a long time, them Nizam lead a privileged and a charmed life. He was considered to be the world’s richest man of his time. \n\n"

        "Nizam Mir Usman Ali Khan Bahadur was conferred with the title of “His Exalted Highness. Geographically, Hyderabad commanded a pivotal position in the heart of India with a population of nearly sixteen million and an area of 82,000 square miles. Hyderabad boasted of its own coinage, paper currency and stamps. Soon afternthe announcement of India’s independence, the Nizam declared his intention not to send representatives to either the Constituent.\n\n"

        "The Indian Government refused to entertain a request that Hyderabad would seek a separate status and Operation Polo was initiated to annex Hyderabad state. The Kannada and Marathi speaking areas of Hyderabad state was then merged with Karnataka and Maharashtra respectively while Telugu speaking region of Telangana was merged with Andhra state with Hyderabad as the capital of united Andhra Pradesh state in 1956. Although there was resentment against the merger, there was a period of calm. \n

        "After the promises made to respect the rights of Telangana were not fulfilled, a separate Telangana agitation was launched in 1969. Following subsequent Gentleman’s agreement and again a period of broken promises and injustice, Telangana movement was given a final push by Shri. K Chandrasekhar Rao in 2001 with the formation of TRS. Finally due to the whole hearted efforts of Telangana society and political parties, the Government of India agreed for creation of a separate Telangana state in July, 2013 and Telangana came into effect on June 2, 2014 as ‘Telangana state’, the 29th state of Indian Union. \n\n"

    <string name="birla_history">"  Birla Mandir is a Hindu temple, built on a 280 feet (85 m) high hillock called Naubath Pahad on a 13 acres (53,000 m2) plot. The construction took 10 years and was constructed in 1976 by Swami Ranganathananda of Ramakrishna Mission. The temple was constructed by Birla Foundation, which has also constructed several similar temples across India, all of which are known as Birla Mandir."
    "<b>Architecture</b>"
    "The temple manifests a blend of Dravidian, Rajasthani and Utkala architectures. It is constructed of 2000 tons of pure white marble. The granite idol of presiding deity Lord Venkateswara is about 11 ft (3.4 m) tall and a carved lotus forms an umbrella on the top. There is a brass flagstaff in the temple premises which rises to a height of 42 ft (13 m). The temple does not have traditional bells, as Swami Ranganathananda wished that the temple atmosphere should be conducive for meditation."
    "<b>About the temple</b>"
        "Apart from the main shrine, the consorts of Lord Venkateswara, Padmavati and Andal are housed in separate shrines. The temple also has separate shrines for various Hindu gods and goddess including Shiva, Shakti, Ganesh, Hanuman, Brahma, Saraswati,Lakshmi and Saibaba. Selected teachings of holy men and Gurbani are engraved on temple walls. Birla temples are open to all, as identified by Mahatma Gandhi and other Hindu leaders."

Since times immemorial, the powerful god’s magnificent and monumental shrine in Orissa draws lakhs of devotees. Jagannath Temple is dedicated to revered God Shri Krishna. Jagan means Universe and Nath is the Lord. He is one of the incarnations of Vishnu."
        "This temple is a replica of the original Jagannath Temple of Puri. However, this temple is much smaller and its design resembles the one in Puri, Orissa. The Hyderabad version of Puri’s temple was built on 3000-square yard area. It is located adjacent to the Telangana Bhavan in the posh suburbs of Banjara Hills. This temple is so captivating that it is tagged as one of the must-visit places of Hyderabad. The most appealing portion of the temple is its “Shikaram” (the peak or the top). It is about 70 feet in height. Sand stones brought from Orissa have been used in the construction of this temple, and that justifies its red colour and around 60 sculptors were employed to carve this awe-inspiring temple."
        "The main idols of the temple are Lord Krishna along with his brother BalaRama and sister Subhadra. It also houses five small temples in the premises, that are dedicated to Lord Ganesh (which is to the left of main entrance), Lord Shiva (in the front), Goddess Bhimala ( to the left on back side), Goddess Lakshmi ( to the right) and two shrines for Navagraha and Shri Hanuman. The temple has three entrances while the main entrance opens right in front of the main temple. One cannot miss noticing the intricately done exterior carving which is considered iconic. The exteriors of the temple are completely made of sand stone while the sanctum sanctorum is done in plain brick wall from the inside. It is considered as one of the modern architectural marvels of Hyderabad city and draws hundreds of visitors every day. It is a place where the city’s Oriya community bond together."

        "   One of the old and among the most revered temples of Hyderabad is the Yellamma Temple located at Balkampet, popularly called the Balkampet Yellamma temple. The temple is thronged by heavy crowd on Sundays and Tuesdays and is quite famous for the annual Bonalu Jathara festivity that takes place in Hyderabad."
        "This temple is dedicated to Goddess Yellamma that literally means 'mother of the universe\'. There is also an alternative name called Jagadamba who is considered the same as Goddess Renuka. According to a legend, Renuka, the daughter of Raja Renuka had married Jamadagni, the son of Satyawati and had five sons, one of them being Parashurama. One day, Renuka couldn\'t perform one of her regular household chores and this enraged her husband who then asked her to leave the house.Dejected Renuka was reportedly suggested by saints to perform pujas near a Shivalinga and feed Brahmins for her penance. Jamadagni was reportedly furious at her and demanded his sons as well to punish their mother Renuka. Others refused and they were burnt to ashes by the father\'s gaze while Parashurama searched for his mother who was hiding in a village, beheaded her and even the poor woman who helped her. Jamadagni who was pleased by his son\'s obedience, gave him a boon and in turn Parashurama asked his father to restore the lives of his brothers, his mother and the village woman. However, during the process, the head of Renuka was restored on the other woman\'s head and vice versa. While Jamadagni accepted the woman who had Renuka\'s body, the other form came to be popular known as Yellamma, which means mother to all and is being devoutly worshipped from then by the people ofTelangana people."
        "Balkampet Yellamma Goddess is also considered as an incarnation of Goddess Kali. Devotees offer animal sacrifice here. The most important event here is the celestial marriage ceremony of the temple goddess, Yellamma Kalyanotsavam. Bonalu Jathara Festival at Balkampet Yellamma Temple falls in the calendar only after Golconda Bonalu Jathara followed by Ujjaini Mahankali Bonalu Jathara each year."
		"The temple was first constructed in 15th Century AD and later renovated in the early 20th century. The idol of the goddess here is seen 10 feet lower than the ground level and the devouts believe that the water in the well here can cure all ailments. The holy water is treated as Theertham. The temple also has Akhand Jyothi, which was lit during the renovation. It is situated at a distance of 10 km from Secunderabad Railway Station and is just 3 km away from Ameerpet junction."

        "   One of the most revered temples of Hyderabad is the Peddamma Temple in Jubilee Hills. There is no clear evidence on when the temple was established, but people consider that it has been here since 150 years. Earlier, it was a small temple but in the year 1993, it gained immense popularity and the Rajagopuram was constructed. The temple witnesses hundreds of devotees pouring in everyday to seek the blessings of Amma. The Peddamma Temple is quite popular in the twin cities, next only to Ujjaini Mahakali Gudi of Secunderabad. The temple is dedicated to Ammavaru who is seen as the mother and people coming to this temple believe that the Goddess is their saviour. The Telangana festival Bonalu is celebrated once in a year, but at this temple, the Bonalu utsavam is celebrated every Sunday. Besides the common people, scores of VIPs, politicians and industrialists visit this temple to offer prayers to the Amma."
        "According to the legend, Lord Shiva, the supreme ascetic, when disturbed by the hostility opened his third eye, which led to the unleashing of fire of doom. Even this couldn\'t arrest Mahishasura\'s march. At that moment, a bright stream of lightning dazzled from the mouths of the creator Brahma, in the form of Goddess Brahmi. Simultaneously, the powers of all the other gods became taking one female form as Mahishasura Mardini, Durga, who killed Mahishasura with her bare hands. The temple is located close to the main road on Jubilee Hills Road No. 55 on the main thoroughfare from Jubilee Hills check post to Hi-tech city."

        "   Sri Ujjaini Mahakaali Temple is a popular temple devoted to Goddess Mahakaali in Secunderabad area of Telangana. Devotees offer their prayers to the goddess every day at this 190-year old temple."
        "According to legend, in the year 1813, a Military Battalion was transferred to Ujjaini. This was a time when there was Cholera outbreak and thousands of people had reportedly perished. Suriti Appaiah who was part of the Military Battalion and his associates reportedly went to Mahakali Devasthanam at Ujjaini and offers prayers that if the people were saved from this epidemic, they would be installing the idol of Mahakaali at Secunderabad. Promptly after his return from Ujjaini, Sri Suriti Appaiah and his associates went ahead and installed the idol of Goddess Mahakaali which was made of wood at Secunderabad in July 1815. During the construction of sanctum sanctorum, a stone idol of Manikyalamma was reportedly found and even that idol was reportedly installed beside Sri Mahakaali Ammavaru."
		"Sri Suriti Appaiah later developed the temple with the help of philanthropic people and this was eventually taken over by the endowments department. Thousands of devotees offer prayers during Ashada jathara, which usually falls on Sunday and Monday."
		"The goddess Ujjain Mahakaali is seen in a Padmasana posture with four hands along with a sword, spear and also a essel of amrut damaru in the form of a beautiful stone idol. The idol is covered with silver and devotees make sacrifices after fulfillment of their wishes."

    <string name="charminar_history">"  Charminar is a monument and a mosque, which is synonymous with the history of Hyderabad, India. The majestic structure was completed in 1591 CE and is not only a landmark building of Hyderabad but also a famous monument of India. It is believed that Mohammed Quli Qutb Shahi, the fifth sultan of the Qutub Shahi dynasty had built the monument to commemorate the end of a deadly plague menace that had gripped the city then. It is located near the bank of the river Musi. Charminar is derived from two distinct words Char and Minar, which means four towers. Mir Momin Astarabadi of Qutb Shah dynasty played an important role and he ordered extensive preparations for the design and layout. Historians believe that this structure is an example for Indo-Islamic architecture combined with few Persian elements. The monument is located in the heart of old city and it is believed that Hyderabad was measured in four directions from Charminar for administrative purposes."
    "A visit to Hyderabad is incomplete without visiting this grand and majestic centerpiece. It is also considered the Arc de Triomphe of the East. Some of the historians say that it was built it in honor of his wife, Bhagyamathi. There is also legend that tells about the existence of a secret tunnel underneath the monument connecting the fort at Golconda that was created as a means of escape to royal family in an emergency. Each of the sides measure 20 meters while the minarets are located at a height of 48.7 meters from the ground level. Each side of Charminar opens into a plaza like structure where the giant arches overlook the major thoroughfares. It is a clear square structure that measures 31.95 mts. on each side while imposing arches span a distance of 11mts. The four minarets rise to a height of 56 mts. The ornamental arches on the minarets enhance the aesthetic value. There are 149 circular steps inside each minaret and one of them is open for tourists to climb and enjoy a breathtaking view of the city. It also houses the oldest mosque in Hyderabad with prayer spaces for the devout to worship."
        "Islamic architecture of those times is marked by arches, minarets, and domes. The structure is famous for its profuse stucco decorations and arrangement of impressive balustrades and balconies. The floral design is executed delicately and stands as a masterpiece to the combination of Mughal and Hindu architecture crafted by the local artisans. The four clocks in four cardinal directions were added in the year 1889. The base of Charminar has a water cistern located at center which consists of a small fountain for ablutions, before the faithful offer prayers in the mosque. Charminar has become synonymous with the culture of old city of Hyderabad and the area is also a popular destination for lip smacking Muslim dishes, colorful bangles, pearls, jewellry and other items. The place is a symbol of Hyderabadi culture and stands tall and proud as a reminder of the glorious era."

    <string name="paigah_history">"  The noble families of Paigah, during the 18th century were among the most influential and powerful families of the Princely State of Hyderabad’s aristocracy. Claiming to be the descendents of the Hazrath Omar bin Al-Khattab, Islam’s second caliph, the nobles of Paigah were believed to be wealthier than the average Maharajah of the country and they were the only ones to have the privilege maintaining their own court, palaces, as well as their own private armies, which often numbered several thousands. Paigah is a Farsi world, which says “footstool”. It means Right-hand man in English."
    "Abdul Fateh Khan Tegh Jung is credited as the founder of the Paigah nobility. He founded the nobility when he served for the second Nizam, Salabat Jang. Sahams-ul-Mulk, Shams-ul-Doula, and Shams-ul-Umara, were the hereditary titles conferred to him by the Nizam. It means “the sun among the masses and nobles”. The Paigahs were given the responsibility to take care of the security and defense of the state. The Paigahs were very close to the Nizams."
        "The Paigahs, who were the great patrons of tarts have extended their unmatched grace and elegance even to their exquisite tombs. The Paigah Tombs that grace the city among the many wonders that fill the pages of the most promising history. The marvelous artistry of the Paigahs is shown in the mosaic tile work that has been inlaid. The Paigah tombs, located at the Pisal Banda suburbs in Hyderabad, are most intricately carved and are enclosed in facades of pierced marble. The tombs are the finest examples of the enthralling Indo-Islamic architecture, which is a blend of both features of Asaf Jahi and Rajputani style."

    <string name="golconda_history">"  Golconda Fort is located in the western part of Hyderabad city and is about 9 km from the Hussain Sagar Lake. The outer fort occupies an area of three square kilometers, which is 4.8 kilometers in length."
    "It was originally known as Mankal, and built on a hilltop in the year 1143. It was originally a mud fort under the reign of Rajah of Warangal. Later it was fortified between 14th and 17th centuries by the Bahmani Sultans and then the ruling Qutub Shahi dynasty. Golconda was the principal capital of the Qutub Shahi kings. The inner fort contains ruins of palaces, mosques and a hill top pavilion, which rises about 130 meters high and gives a bird’s eye view of other buildings."
        "Golconda fort is undoubtedly one of most magnificent fortress complexes in India. The history of Golconda Fort goes back to early 13th century, when it was ruled by the Kakatiya’s followed by Qutub Shahi kings, who ruled the region in 16th and 17th century. The fortress rests on a granite hill 120 meters high while huge crenellated ramparts surround this structure."
        "It was initially called Shepherd’s Hill, meaning Golla Konda in Telugu while according to legend, on this rocky hill a shepherd boy had come across an idol and the information was conveyed to the ruling Kakatiya king at that time. The king constructed a mud fort around this holy spot and after 200 years, Bahamani rulers took possession of the place. Later the Qutub Shahi kings converted this into massive granite fort extending 5km in circumference. The fort is considered a mute witness to historic events. The Qutub Shahis reign at Golconda ended in 1687 when it was run over by Mughal emperor Aurangzeb, who intentionally left it in ruins."
        "Golconda still boasts of mounted cannons, four drawbridges, eight gateways, and majestic halls, magazines, stables etc. The outermost enclosure is called Fateh Darwaza meaning Victory gate, after Aurangzeb’s army marched successfully through this gate. At Fateh Darwaza one can witness fantastic acoustical effects, which is one among the many famous engineering marvels at Golconda. Clapping your hand at a certain point near the dome entrance reverberates which is heard clearly at the hill top pavilion, almost one kilometer away. This served as a warning note to the inhabitants of the fort of any impending danger, Ofcourse it now amuses visitors. The fort gains an impressive place among the architectural marvels and heritage structures of India and is a testimony to Hyderabad’s glorious past."

This secret lake is situated close to Shilparamam craft village, at the city’s software hub, Hitech city. The reason behind this intriguing name is indistinct but old timers assert that for many years the lake remained hidden as there were no roads to reach the place and it was well kept away from naked eye for twenty years. The Durgam Cheruvu is a secluded location that is spread over an area of sixty-three acres and is a picturesque location surrounded by green pastures and scenic hills of the Deccan Plateau. This secret lake has now been developed into a haven for visitors. The authorities maintaining the lake have introduced boating facilities to lure the people visiting the exotic place. The visitors throng this place for the entertaining activities like fishing, which is very rare in the city. There is a restaurant for people looking for some refreshments. This appealing lake serves as one best place for the film shootings. It is also the most recommended picnic spot for busy Hyderabadis who look for a rejuvenating weekend.

    <string name="mrugavani_history">"  The present day world has created its orbit around technology and modernism. The modern way of living has extensive demands and more and more of our Earth’s space and resources is what is at stake for. One can observe that national parks have eventually become the last sights of refuge for most indigenous species of animals as well as plants around the globe. Even governments of several countries have now become conscious of the importance of preserving these last species in wildlife sanctuaries."
        "   The Mrugavani National Park in the state capital is an example of a beautiful national park turned major tourist attraction. What is most exciting is that in a land layered with exotic and immense natural resources like in India, it sure is a great achievement. The Mrugavani National Park, located at Chilkuru in Moinabad, is at a distance of about 25 kms from Hyderabad. The National Park is spread over 3.5 sq kms of pure, untamed land. The Indian government announced it a wildlife sanctuary in the year 1994 and since then, the park has been home to some 600 species of plants and animals. Like in the case of most national parks, even the Mrugavani national park has had least human intervention and interaction in order to make sure that all the precious creatures remain undisturbed in their cozy natural habitat."

Here only one gate opens at a time and you will find yourself surrounded by an entirely different world of wild animals like lions, tigers, rhinos, panthers, wild oxen, etc. that roam freely in the wilderness of a jungle-like environment. Visitors can make their trip more interesting by visiting the pre-historic dinosaur park, a nocturnal zoo, a natural history museum, a mini-train, several parks, and animal rides, which makes it an ideal spot for picnic. The nocturnal animals and the reptiles constitute another interesting and exciting part of the whole experience."
